# Get License Information

CommunityBridge Security identifies the licenses that are used by your projects and their dependencies.

**Do these steps:**

1. Select **Licenses** from the top menu.

   All licenses are listed in alphabetical order for the dependencies in a project by their license identifier, for example, `Apache-2.0`. The list also shows the number of dependencies for each license. Dependencies with more than one license are shown individually. ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/gitbook-28427.appspot.com/o/assets%2Flinux-foundation-documentation%2F-M2Y1B8nWSwvFgFqqkM-%2F-M2Y1EN5kHSFNDEPcJP7%2F7410959.png?generation=1584356986045684&alt=media)â€‹

2. Click a license **identifier** to go to the SPDX License and find out more information about a license. The SPDX License includes a full name, standardized short identifier, vetted license text, and other information about the license.
3. Click **Export as CSV** to export the data to a Comma-Separated Values \(CSV\) file, which you can open, save, or both. Here is an example snippet of an exported CSV file from the Licenses tab:
